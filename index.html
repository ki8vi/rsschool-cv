                <p>In my life, I have worked in various fields, each of which has provided me with valuable life experience and broadened my horizons. As far as I can remember, I have always enjoyed learning something new because learning is never too late. I have always been fascinated by different technologies, and even from my early childhood, my bookshelf was filled with science fiction books. Recently, I have immersed myself in learning programming, and itâ€™s incredibly fascinating. My goal is to push the boundaries of my skills, refine my practice in building complex systems, and bring my imagination to life through real projects. I strive to expand my knowledge and expertise, and I am passionate about turning my ideas into tangible solutions.</p>
